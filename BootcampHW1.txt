Hi! My name is Tonny Xie, and I am born and raised in Miami, Florida. 
Fall 2015 will be the beginning of my third year of studying Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. During my free time, I would like to engage in badminton, play various video games, listen to music, and watch YouTube, Netflix, or Crunchyroll.

I hope to obtain an internship in Gainesville for the upcoming summer in order to sign up for classes as well.

Quotes

"What do you do when there is an evil you cannot destroy by just means? Do you stain your hands with evil to destroy evil? Or do you remain steadfastly just and rigtheous even if it means surrendering to evil?"
- Lelouch Lamperouge

"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."
- William Shakespeare

"Courage is the magic that turns dreams into reality."
- Richter Abend

"There is something in this world which no one has ever seen. It is soft and sweet. If it is spotted, I'm sure everyone will want to have it. Which is why no one has ever seen it. For this world has hidden it quite well, so that it is difficult to obtain. But, There will come a day when it is discovered by somebdy, And only those who should obtain it will be able to find it."
- Aisaka Taiga & Takasu Ryuuji
